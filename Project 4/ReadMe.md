In this network the design of a optimized network is approached step-by-step 
to achieve the target validation accuracy of minimum 99.4% with less than 15K parameters.
The below mentioned are the incremental updates to the network to reach the target.

1. Network with less than 15k parameters
2. Adding Batch Normalization and Dropout
3. Adding dynamic learning rate
4. Increasing Batch Size

Inference of each iteration is commented in the notebook.
